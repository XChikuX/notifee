### Android

The APIs for Android allow for creating rich, styled and highly interactive notifications. Below you'll find guides that cover the supported Android features.

Below you'll find guides that cover the supported iOS features.

| Topic                                                             |                                                                          |

### Jest Testing

To run jest tests after integrating this module, you will need to mock out the native parts of Notifee or you will get an error that looks like:

```bash
 ● Test suite failed to run

    Notifee native module not found.

      59 |     this._nativeModule = NativeModules[this._moduleConfig.nativeModuleName];
      60 |     if (this._nativeModule == null) {
    > 61 |       throw new Error('Notifee native module not found.');
         |             ^
      62 |     }
      63 |
      64 |     return this._nativeModule;
```

Add this to a setup file in your project e.g. `jest.setup.js`:

If you don't already have a Jest setup file configured, please add the following to your Jest configuration file and create the new jest.setup.js file in project root:

```js
setupFiles: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
```

You can then add the following line to that setup file to mock `notifee`:

```js
jest.mock('@psync/notifee', () => require('@psync/notifee/jest-mock'))
```

You will also need to add `@psync/notifee` to `transformIgnorePatterns` in your config file (`jest.config.js`):

```bash
transformIgnorePatterns: [
    'node_modules/(?!(jest-)?react-native|@react-native|@psync/notifee)'
]
```

### Detox Testing

To utilise Detox's functionality to mock a local notification and trigger notifee's event handlers, you will need a payload with a key `__notifee_notification`:

```js
{
  title: 'test',
  body: 'Body',
  payload: {
    __notifee_notification: {
      ios: {
        foregroundPresentationOptions: {
          banner: true,
          list: true,
        },
      },
      data: {}
    },
  },
}
```

The important part is to make sure you have a `__notifee_notification` object under `payload` with the default properties.

## Firebase Integration

If using Firebase Cloud Messaging with Notifee, see the [Firebase Migration Guide](./FIREBASE_MIGRATION_v14_to_v23.md) for upgrading from v14 to v23.

**Note**: Firebase Dynamic Links has been deprecated and removed. Migrate to Universal Links (iOS) and App Links (Android) for deep linking functionality.
